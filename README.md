# Git - The Simpler Guide

http://mattleblanc.github.com/git-guide/

@mattleblanc forked the guide to strip out a lot of extra stuff that had made it in -- we're going back to there being 'no deep shit' in the guide. ;)

The original was by @rogerdudler, whose contact information is available at the top of http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ if you require it.
